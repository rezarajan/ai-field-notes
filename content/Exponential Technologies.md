Exponential technologies are ones which experience exponential growth, usage and adoption over a period of time. They were the key enablers of the previous industrial revolutions, and will be for those to come.

The attributes which characterize such exponential technologies are:
- Exponentially decreasing costs of using the technology
- Democratization of the technology; there is ubiquitous access to it
## Exponential Technologies as Catalysts for Industrial Revolutions
Industrial revolutions have historically been characterized by a change in labour - the way people have worked. Primarily, this was due to the advent of exponential technologies which would improve labour efficiency at large, resulting in unemployment for some and enabling others to move on to better jobs.

Below are the exponential technologies served as catalysts for the industrial revolutions:
- The First Industrial RevoÂ­lution: steam and mechanization
- The Second Industrial Revolution: electric power and mass production
- The Third Industrial Revolution (current): digitization and information technology
## Challenges of Exponential Technologies
There is an important consideration when dealing with exponential technologies; while all technologies may be used for both good or evil, the challenge with exponential technologies is that they tend to have exponential consequences.

In the wrong hands, there may be dire consequences to using these technologies. Companies may attempt to self-regulate and laws may be instantiated to provide boundaries, but the rate at which these regulations are implemented will struggle to keep pace with the rapid advances in technology development, adoption, and the resulting societal changes.
