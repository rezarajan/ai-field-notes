Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the branch of computer science which focuses on the creation of systems with the ability to mimic human intelligence. It is a broad field which encompasses many categorizations and specializations; some examples include:
- text, object and speech recognition and synthesis
- inference, decision making and planning and
- predictive analytics
# Terminology
Due to the broad reach of AI across many applications, the term AI has become something of a colloquial term. However, it is important to understand the distinction between different AI systems, and how they may be described. To simplify this process, AI may be described by its [[Classes, Categories and Architectures of AI Systems|class, category and architecture]].

## Machine Learning in AI
For many of the common AI systems used in the real-world to work they need to be trained on large datasets; the field of training AI to learn and adapt over time is called [[Machine Learning]]. Of importance to note is that there are also AI models which do not utilize machine learning, and so there is a distinction to be made here.

For examples of different AI models, see:
- [[Examples of ML Models|Examples of Machine Learning Models]]
- [[Symbolic AI#Examples of Symbolic AI|Examples of Non-Machine Learning Models]]

## Describing AI Tools
Take the following example of GPT-3 below: 

![[Examples of ML-Based AI Tools#GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)]]

GPT-3 may be described as a **weak AI** **LLM** used for **generative** NLP tasks by producing responses to input prompts. In practice, the class of weak AI may be omitted as there is no strong AI in existence anyway, but it is imperative that the generative category descriptor be specified here since LLMs may also function in discriminative tasks such as name extraction from text, or text-based spam detection in emails.

For a non-exhaustive list of commonly used AI tools, see [[Examples of ML-Based AI Tools]].

# Advantages and Drawbacks
AI is termed as an [[Exponential Technologies|exponential technology]], meaning that it is both being improved and democratized at an exponential rate. While these technologies have their benefits, they also present many [[Exponential Technologies#Challenges of Exponential Technologies|challenges]] in regulating. Some of their advantages and drawbacks are outlined here: [[Advantages and Drawbacks of AI]].
