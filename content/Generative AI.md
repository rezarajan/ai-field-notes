Generative AI refers to systems which generate new data based on some input data. They work by training an AI model to learn the probability distribution which characterizes the training data, and produce new data based on the input data applied to those distributions.

Typically, training involves massive compute to be able to accurately represent a variety of data through probability distributions; thus it is common to find that generative models involve deep learning and neural networks.

They are trained from [[Foundational Models in Artificial Intelligence|foundational models]], which serve to bootstrap the training process by providing a known set of good parameters for the model, for generative tasks in a specific domain; in other words, these foundational models serve as a starting point or checkpoint in training.
## Use Cases
- Image, text and sound generation
- Personal Assistants
