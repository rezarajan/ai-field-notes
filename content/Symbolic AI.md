Symbolic AI systems rely on logic, rules, and predefined knowledge to perform tasks, often without learning from data. Symbolic AI focuses on manipulating symbols to represent knowledge and perform reasoning through explicit rules (e.g., "if-then" statements). Expert systems and knowledge-based systems are examples of symbolic AI, where human expertise is encoded into the system in the form of rules or facts. These systems perform tasks like decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning, without relying on statistical learning.

## Examples of Symbolic AI
1. Expert Systems
	 - **Type:** Non-ML-based AI model
	 - **Purpose:** Mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a specific domain by using a knowledge base and a set of rules to draw inferences.
	 - **Example Use Case:** Medical diagnosis, troubleshooting, and technical support.
	 - **How It Works:** Expert systems use a knowledge base of facts and a set of "if-then" rules to simulate the reasoning process of human experts. The system applies these rules to data inputs to make decisions or solve problems.
		 - For example, a medical expert system might use a knowledge base of symptoms and diseases and apply inference rules to suggest possible diagnoses based on input symptoms from a patient.
	- **AI/ML Context:** Expert systems are a classic example of non-ML AI since they don't "learn" from data but rather use predefined rules and logic to perform tasks. They rely on knowledge representation and reasoning, which is part of symbolic AI.
