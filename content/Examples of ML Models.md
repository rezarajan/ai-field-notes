#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning)
- **Purpose:** Process structured grid-like data, typically used for image-related tasks.
- **Example Use Case:** Image classification, object detection, facial recognition.
- **How It Works:** CNNs automatically detect spatial hierarchies in images by using convolutional layers that apply filters to detect patterns at different levels of abstraction.
- **AI/ML Context:** Part of AI but specifically an ML model used for vision-related tasks.
#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning)
- **Purpose:** Generate realistic synthetic data by pitting two models (generator and discriminator) against each other.
- **Example Use Case:** Image generation, video generation, data augmentation.
- **How It Works:** A generator creates data, and a discriminator distinguishes between real and fake data. Both networks improve through competition.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
 - **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning)
 - **Purpose:** Process sequential data, useful for tasks involving time-series or language.

 - **AI/ML Context:** An ML model within AI systems that handle sequential data.
#### Transformer Networks
- **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning)
- **Purpose:** Process sequential data, primarily used in natural language processing (NLP).
- **Example Use Case:** Machine translation, text summarization, question answering.
- **How It Works:** Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to process all elements of the sequence in parallel, significantly improving training efficiency.
- **AI/ML Context:** Part of AI, specifically used in ML models for NLP tasks.
#### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning, Transformer-based)
- **Purpose:** Understand and generate human language at a large scale.
- **Example Use Case:** Text generation, summarization, translation (e.g., GPT-4, BERT).
- **How It Works:** LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate or understand language by predicting the likelihood of word sequences.
- **AI/ML Context:** ML models that drive powerful AI systems for NLP tasks.
#### Autoencoders
- **Type:** ML system (Deep Learning)
- **Purpose:** Compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and reconstruct it, typically used for anomaly detection, noise reduction, or dimensionality reduction.
- **Example Use Case:** Image denoising, anomaly detection in financial transactions.
- **How It Works:** Autoencoders compress input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then reconstruct the original input from that representation.
- **AI/ML Context:** ML model used within AI systems for data compression and anomaly detection.
#### Decision Trees
- **Type:** ML system (Traditional ML)
- **Purpose:** Classify data or predict continuous outcomes based on splitting data at decision nodes.
- **Example Use Case:** Classifying emails as spam or predicting loan defaults.
- **How It Works:** A decision tree splits data based on feature values at each node, creating a hierarchical structure of decisions leading to a prediction.
- **AI/ML Context:** Traditional ML model used in AI systems for decision-making tasks.
#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Type:** ML system (Traditional ML)
- **Purpose:** Classify data into distinct classes by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates the classes.
- **Example Use Case:** Image classification (e.g., cats vs. dogs), text classification.
- **How It Works:** SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes, which can be extended to handle non-linear data with kernel functions.
- **AI/ML Context:** Classic ML model used in AI for classification tasks.
#### Random Forests
- **Type:** ML system (Traditional ML)
- **Purpose:** Improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **Example Use Case:** Predicting customer churn, loan default, and disease diagnosis.
- **How It Works:** Random forests generate multiple decision trees from random subsets of data and features, and combine their outputs for improved accuracy.
- **AI/ML Context:** Ensemble ML model used in AI for prediction and classification tasks.
#### K-Means Clustering
- **Type:** ML system (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Purpose:** Group data into clusters based on similarity, without needing labeled data.
- **Example Use Case:** Customer segmentation in marketing or grouping similar documents in text analysis.
- **How It Works:** K-Means assigns data points to one of K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. The algorithm iteratively refines cluster centroids.
- **AI/ML Context:** Unsupervised ML model used in AI for clustering tasks.
#### Linear Regression
- **Type:** ML system (Supervised Learning)
- **Purpose:** Predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.
- **Example Use Case:** Predicting house prices based on features like square footage and location.
- **How It Works:** Linear regression fits a linear relationship between input features and the target variable, predicting the target based on the learned parameters.
- **AI/ML Context:** ML model for regression tasks in AI systems.
