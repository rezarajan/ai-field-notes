A machine learning (ML) system is a mathematical representation or algorithm which is trained on a dataset to make accurate predictions and decisions on new data, *without being explicitly programmed.* Through the constant generation of new data, these models are able to be re-trained and adapted to improve over time.

Machine learning is a *specific subset* of artificial intelligence (AI), which focuses on developing systems which can learn and improve automatically. The concept of AI differs from ML in that AI encompasses the broader goal of developing intelligent systems which mimic human intelligence, while ML focuses on developing systems which can automatically learn. In practice, ML is an integral component of enabling AI systems to function in real-world environments as it provides a way for AI models to learn and improve over time.
## Training
ML models may be trained using three types of methods:
- **Supervised learning:** training is based on a labelled set of data which the model aims to predict
- **Unsupervised learning:** the training dataset contains unlabeled data, and it is entirely up to the model to find and resolve characteristics and features within the data.
- **Reinforcement learning:** an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form or rewards or penalties, and optimizes for the cumulative reward over time.
