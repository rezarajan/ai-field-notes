AI systems may be described by identifying their class, category and architecture.
## Class
The class of an AI system describes the extent to which they are able to mimic human cognition and abilities. There are two main classes: [[Weak AI]] and [[Strong AI]].

All currently existing AI systems are weak AI, and strong AI is, at the time of writing, a purely theoretical technology.
## Category
The category of an AI system describes the type of work that the system performs. There are generally three distinct categories: [[Discriminative AI]], [[Generative AI]] and [[Symbolic AI]]. Discriminative and generative AI are usually examples of [[Machine Learning]] models, while symbolic AI is purely non-ML. 
## Architecture
The architecture of an AI system refers to the specific methodological or computational approach it uses to perform tasks. AI architectures vary depending on whether the system is based on [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] or [[Symbolic AI|symbolic reasoning]].
