#### GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)
- **Type:** Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Class:** Weak AI
- **Category**: Generative 
- **Subcategory:** Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Description:** GPT-3 is a generative AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on input prompts. It can perform a variety of NLP tasks, such as answering questions, writing essays, and generating creative content.
#### Tesla Autopilot
- **Type:** Autonomous Driving System
- **Class:** Weak AI
- **Category:** Mixed (object detection and decision making are deterministic; localization and mapping is both deterministic and generative in Tesla's implementation)
- **Subcategory:** Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision
- **Description:** Tesla Autopilot uses a combination of neural networks and computer vision to drive a car autonomously. It recognizes road signs, lane boundaries, pedestrians, and other vehicles to make driving decisions.
#### YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Class:** Weak AI
- **Category:** Discriminative
- **Subcategory:** Computer Vision, Object Detection
- **Description:** YOLO is a real-time object detection system. It detects and classifies objects within an image by analyzing it in a single pass, making it much faster than traditional methods.
#### DeepFakes (GAN-based)
- **Type:** Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- **Class:** Weak AI
- **Category:** Generative
- **Subcategory:** Deep Learning, Image/Video Synthesis
- **Description:** DeepFakes use GANs to create realistic fake videos and images by swapping faces or generating human-like motions. It is a form of generative AI used for media manipulation.

#### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Type:** Transformer-based Model
- **Class:** Weak AI
- **Category:** Discriminative
- **Subcategory:** Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Description:** BERT is a model designed for various NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis. It is pretrained to understand context from both directions of text (left and right).

*Note: all the above models are classified as weak AI. This is because strong AI is purely theoretical at the time of writing (08/12/2024).*
