Discriminative AI refers to systems which aim to identify patterns and features in the input data. Generally speaking, they identify the features or boundaries which separate distinct classes or categories of objects in the training data, and uses that knowledge to label input data.
## Use Cases
Some use cases include:
- speech and text recognition
- object detection in images
- sentiment analysis and regression
