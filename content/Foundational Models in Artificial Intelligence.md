Foundation models are large-scale algorithms that act as the core framework for many AI systems. They are crucial for the training and progression of ML models, as they enable these systems to build on the knowledge encoded in the foundational models themselves, essentially serving as a starting point for creating more advanced models.

For instance, in natural language processing applications like translators, speech synthesis, or specialized chatbots, a foundational [[LLMs - Large Language Models|large language model (LLM)]] might be employed as a starting point. This base LLM provides the foundational ability to process language in a way that is both coherent and contextually aware. From there, additional fine-tuning or modifications can be applied to tailor the model for a specific task or application.
