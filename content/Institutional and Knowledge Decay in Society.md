Institutional and knowledge decay means that we no longer live in an objective, but rather badly subjective world. For every event, everyone has a different opinion and nobody knows how to converge to a conclusion.

This results from distrust in our knowledge sources, and how these sources of "truth" have been created.
# The Solution to Knowledge Decay is a Virtuous System
The system which enables society to co-exist with exponential technologies like AI is one which focuses the use of these tools to empower the masses with truth and freedom. Thus, this system must overcome the subjectivity of information, and exemplify **form and structure** to establish **virtue**.

This is not a new concept by any means - academic institutions since long have been using rigorous research methodologies and peer-reviews to hold researches accountable for the information that is published to the world. However, the problem is that these are no longer the primary sources of information for the masses, and one must be developed which is applicable to the modern times. Such a virtuous system must be:
1. Scalable: accessible to all and be able to serve billions of people
2. Affordable: people must not be financially constrained to access and use such a system
3. User-friendly: provide a low-barrier to entry for most
4. Build on missing key features of other existing systems: such pieces as privacy, automated regulation and sovereign identity.
